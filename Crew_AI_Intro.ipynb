The classical approaches and current technological advancements for identifying, categorizing, and reducing the harmful effects of natural catastrophes are discussed in this review article. First Online: 11 July 2023 76 Accesses Part of the Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies book series (SIST,volume 351) Abstract As computing power rises and machine learning algorithms improve, new options for flood detection are opened up using machine learning methodologies. According to a report by the World Meteorological Organization, floods have caused 11,072 disaster reports, 2,064,929 deaths, and a total economic loss of US$ 3.6 trillion between 1970 and 2019 ( WMO, 2021 ). In 2021, there were 206 major flood disasters worldwide, causing over 4393 deaths and affecting 29.2 million people. These flood disasters resulted in direct economic losses exceeding USD 74.6 billion, accounting for about 30% of total disaster economic losses (Global Natural Disaster Assessment Report, 2022).

            "From my research, it is evident that flood disasters are a significant issue, especially in Africa. These disasters have resulted in numerous deaths and economic loss. The World Meteorological Organization reported that between 1970 and 2019, floods caused 2,064,929 deaths and a total economic loss of US$ 3.6 trillion. Additionally, in 2021, there were 206 major flood disasters worldwide, which resulted in over 4393 deaths and affected 29.2 million people. These disasters led to direct economic losses exceeding USD 74.6 billion, accounting for about 30% of total disaster economic losses. \n",

            "The field of machine learning and advanced computing power has opened up new opportunities for flood detection. Specifically, a statistical deep learning approach based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed to predict extreme floods and droughts. This approach is crucial for efficient disaster management as it helps identify and categorize natural disasters.\n",

            "Therefore, applying supervised machine learning to the analysis of flood disasters in Africa could significantly improve our ability to predict and manage such disasters, potentially saving lives and reducing economic losses. The next steps would involve gathering data and developing a suitable model using supervised machine learning techniques.\n"

            "Floods, a catastrophic natural disaster, have long plagued humanity, especially in regions like Africa. Between 1970 and 2019, they've accounted for over 2 million deaths and an astounding $3.6 trillion in economic losses according to the World Meteorological Organization. In 2021 alone, floods have claimed over 4,393 lives, affected 29.2 million people, and led to a staggering $74.6 billion in direct economic losses, making up almost 30% of total disaster economic losses. \n",
            "\n",
            "So, what if we could predict these disastrous events before they happen? This is where the power of Machine Learning (ML) comes into play. \n",
            "\n",
            "Machine Learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. This technology, coupled with the advancements in computing power, opens up a world of possibilities, including predicting and managing flood disasters. \n",
            "\n",
            "One method proposed is the use of a 'Convolutional Neural Network', a deep learning algorithm that can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects of the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. This approach can be instrumental in predicting extreme floods and droughts, and even categorizing different types of natural disasters. \n",
            "\n",
            "What this means is that we could use Machine Learning to analyze the data of past flood disasters in Africa, learn from it, and predict future occurrences. This could dramatically improve our ability to manage such disasters, significantly reducing the loss of lives and economic damage. \n",
            "\n",
            "The journey towards making this a reality involves gathering relevant data and developing a model using 'supervised machine learning techniques', where the computer is trained using data that is well-labeled, so it can grasp patterns that can predict future outcomes. \n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, by harnessing machine learning, we could turn the tide against flood disasters, potentially saving lives and reducing economic losses. The future of disaster management could very well lie in the power of Machine Learning.\n"
